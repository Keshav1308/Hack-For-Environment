As per some independent research, if the computer is on for eight hours a day then it uses almost 600 kWh and emits 175 kg of CO2 per year. A laptop uses between 50 and 100 W/hour when it is being used, depending on the model. A laptop that is on for eight hours a day uses between 150 and 300 kWh and emits between 44 and 88 kg of CO2 per year. 

Quite often we see the servers, desktops and other devices are up and running during non-business hours. By turning off the servers\desktops\other device during non-business hours we can limit the carbon emission. With the help of "Azure Monitor" , "Azure Automation" , "Azure Hybrid Runbook worker" and "Azure IOT" we can build a "Full Stack Solution" that will identify the devices which are not required during "non-business hours" and turn them off during non productive hours. 

Azure Monitor will be used here for monitoring and Azure Automation will be used for controlling the devices. With this solution lot of electricity can be saved and eventually it will reduce the Carbon foot print.
